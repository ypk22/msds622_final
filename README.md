# Paul Kim Final Project MSDS622 Data Visualization

This is my github repo for the final for MSDS622, Data Visualization at the University of San Francisco.
The data I was working with is from the Global Terorrism Database at the University of Maryland, which can be found here: https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/

final.ipynb contains all code used for the Plotly maps, and final.twb is the workbook for the treemap which was made in Tableau.
